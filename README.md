# AndroidDeveloperCert

This is the ruby gem that interfaces between ta-web and Google's AAD test API. 

## Installation

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

The client registers exams to the API, this is the only action.
```ruby
    creds = JSON.parse(GCP_JSON_KEY)
    client = AndroidDeveloperCert::Client.new(creds)
    module_name = client.register(user.uid, user.email, "AAD", assessment.id, exam_language: exam_language)
    # module name is also the name of an AbilityScreenVariant in ta-web
```
